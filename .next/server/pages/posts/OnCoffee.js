The machine itself takes a few minutes to warm up.\\nHe then measures the dripped liquid. After tasting, he makes adjustments and dials the grind on the beans. He then froths the milk and serves it to me. He’ll try to make latte art and fail miserably. He’s proud of the coffee he serves me, and it is delicious.\\nBut why go through all the fuss? I would enjoy a cup of instant coffee just as much. And yet, I’ve never felt prideful of a cup of instant coffee, regardless of how much sugar I add to it. Before reading Heidegger, I didn’t understand what value could such a pretentious performance bring. I like instant coffee because it doesn’t require any labour. Arendt claims that technology is necessary, but automation would ruin us. Albert Borgmann expands on Arendt’s fears by making a distinction between things and devices: things require engagement and bring people together. Devices do the opposite; they automate an action and tend to make people drift apart. They are not necessarily cathartic or require skills.\\nDoes Marx’s vision of cathartic, creative labour [^1] even apply here when so much of ‘the ideal way to make coffee’ is rooted in capital? Coffee in itself is the drink of enhanced productivity. What does the process of making coffee, done in the two ways, say about our class divide? The anthropocentric utilitarianism of homo faber has found its greatest expression in the Kantian formula that no man must ever become a means to an end, that every human being is an end in himself.\"\n            }, undefined, false, {\n                fileName: \"/Users/yuchi/GitHub Projects/blog/pages/posts/OnCoffee.mdx\",\n                lineNumber: 19,\n                columnNumber: 1\n            }, this),\n            \"\\n\",\n            (0,react_jsx_dev_runtime__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.jsxDEV)(_components.p, {\n                children: \"[^2]\\xa0Conditions in the current system are defined by the solitude of an entrepreneur who practices auto-exploitation voluntarily. Under the guise of self-production and expression, possessions are a means of reproduction. A more refined taste is a measure of human capital. In the dialectical Aufhenung, the Italian Barista Machine uplifts but also traps.\\nMy partner would argue it is not the machine that traps. His family members have espresso machines, but they don’t commit to intellectually analyzing their espresso. They make it and drink it, regardless of if it’s bad or good. There is a certain bliss in this lack of attention to detail. Is noticing the finer notes a virtue in a sense? Who can afford to put in care? Is it valuable to be able to do so?\\nThe different ways how things work give rise to the different possibilities of experiences. Heidegger believed that technology shapes us irrevocably in certain ways. There is no way out. How does instant coffee shape me? I wonder if the proletariat-bourgeoise divide hinges on such elitist assigning of value. Take a mundane thing that nearly everyone engages in, fracture it, and associate the fragments with class.
