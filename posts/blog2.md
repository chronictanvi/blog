What is a bad day for you? When are the vibes off?

I am writing this with a mild headache, I didn't go outside all day today evern though it was wwarmer than yesterday. I feel slightly nauseous. I've been too dysfunctional to pick up 40 mg of prozac so I just eat 4 of 10mg every day. This morning, I found my cat in his usual spot — on his bed in the living room — warming his belly under the sun. I said my part — I didn't hold back my feelings, why do I still feel terrible?

Who can comfort me?
