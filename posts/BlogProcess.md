I first started with next.js
I tried vite but for some reason didn't follow through with that.
I then did this react tutorial
Got some help from Nick on what are props states etc and understanding the heirarchy of how a form works.

I looked a lot at Maggie Appleton's blog, but also tried to understadn what choices are out there in terms of the packages she used

Like styled-components, emotion, plain css, tailwind [[insert rant about tailwind here]]]

I don't want to be a developer developer. 
Being a mediocre developer is good enough. 

Designer, cultural anthropoligist, mediocre developer. â€” Maggie Appleton
