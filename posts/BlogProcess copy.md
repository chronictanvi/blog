How do we have so many media that are critiques of capitalism, yet so many people who have faith in capitalist?

What is the problem?

Are these critiques not intense enough, are things not spelled out enough?

I watched pinnochio recently, it was rather depressing, and devoid of joy. Pinnochio and everyone around him experience death so severly and overwhelmingly, it almost comes across as a forced attempt to numb the viewer to it.

Its okay — he'll come back around.

What did I want? the film to just end whenever someone dies? A moment of silence? Perhaps the problem doesn't lie with the gravity of the deaths — death feels numbing because it causes me dissociate. Is Pinnochio an anti-facist film, because it dunks on Mussolini? Is that the takeway a child watching the movie might have? I don't know any children.

What about Alice in Wonderland, White Lotus, etc?
