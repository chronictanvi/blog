**Outline**
- Social dynamics: 

I have been on this project for a while, it is one of the first projects I have committed to over a span of multiple years. Working with students is unique in the sense its very musch driven by out personal motivation.

Taking the specific designs for each timeline and standardising it a bit — 

- Timeline 
How do we want to get a sense of un-chronology?
Randomness? 
What are groupings are meaningful? 
Where do we start? Brooks? Peabody? 

- I think everybody coming on to the project, especially working with DuBois, felt a certain tension — none of the students working on the project were black. Is it our place to be doing this work? Should someone else do it? Should someone else be included? 

Mentorship by Silas Munro was a guiding light, also Lauren encouraged us to read these books: 

I personally read 
    - Love songs for Du Bois 
    - heard this podcast 
    - worked on this episode of BIPOC Design History with Silas and Jason Forrest 
    - 

The student visualisation changed from being a list of names that were organised reflecting the aesthetics of DuBois — spirals — to soemthing else entirely. 

We focused on other information that DuBois had published, there is always more data than visualisation. 

We looked at the trauma knots project.

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
