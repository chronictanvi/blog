Documenting the project

I started with the CAA, thats my background. It was the first time I witnessed a revolution play out, I was 18. It was immediate, it happened in my news feed, timeline, dashboard. My friends stories. WhatsApp forwards I received. I experienced it digitally.

I think any illusions I had of the internet being a place solely for togetherness and community faded away. Its just a tool — a hammer behaves differently in the hands of a carpenter, a toddler, a really angry person. [Heiddegar]

I started by thinking, well, what are the things that would've mattered?

Maybe access to links — At that time stories on IG didn't have the ability to embedd a link available to everyone. So information wasn't traceable. There was no source.

Or an ability to respond differently, perhaps I don't want to share brutal videos of a girl getting beat up by the cops. I don't want to like. I saw it, though. I want to acknowledge it somehow.

How do I share an opinon I am unsure of? That I might later disavow? That is challenging?
What about resources? I grew up in India but my history is muddy, if not biased.

###What are the properties of an anarchist platform?
What is the anarchist internet?

Mutual aid

Networked thoughts that aren't traced to an individual but to a moment, a community

###What are the properties of a capitalist, neoliberal platform?

It promotes crisis, commodity. Its polarising.
