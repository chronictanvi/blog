<IntroParagraph>

Kdrama I watched in 2022 that I recommend **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

</IntroParagraph>

- **Tomorrow** grim reapers that help people not commit _suicide_.
- **Attorney Woo** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on
- **Black Dog**

- **Attorney Woo**
- **Attorney Woo**
- **Attorney Woo**
- **Attorney Woo**

- **Hospital Playlist**
- **Attorney Woo**

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
